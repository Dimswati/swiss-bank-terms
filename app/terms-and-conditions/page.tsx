If the Customer requests the Bank to cancel any transaction or instruction after a Request has been received by the Bank from the Customer, the Bank shall cancel such transaction or instruction if it has not been effected by the time of receipt of Customer notice. 6.2 The Bank shall be entitled to accept and to act upon any request, even if that Request is otherwise for any reason incomplete or ambiguous if, in its absolute discretion, the Bank believes that it can correct the incomplete or ambiguous information in the Request without reference to the Customer being necessary. 6.3 The Bank shall not be obliged to accept or to act upon any Request if to do so would require access to, action by, or information from the Branch, or any Bank Subsidiary located in any jurisdiction where it is not a Banking Day at the relevant time when such access, action or information is required or would cause a breach of any existing mandate facility limit or agreement between the Bank, the Branch and/or Bank Subsidiary (as applicable) and the Customer. In the event that the Bank does accept or act upon any such Request, the Customer shall remain liable thereof. 6.4 In the event of any conflict between any terms of any Request from the Customer and the terms of these Terms and Conditions, the terms of these Terms and Conditions shall prevail. These Terms and Conditions and all authorizations and other procedures agreed under these Terms and Conditions supplement any General Terms and Conditions and any mandates, which apply to the Customer&#39;s Bank Accounts with the Bank.</p>
